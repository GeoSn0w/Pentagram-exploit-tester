# Pentagram-exploit-tester
A test app to check if your device is vulnerable to CVE-2021-30955.

This tool incorporates @b1n4r1b01's kernel exploit based on CVE-2021-30955 and will run it on your device to test if the device is compatible.

Exploit is known to work with iOS 15.0 to 15.1.1 and 15.2 BETA 1 4GB devices!

* If the device is compatible, you will get an alert telling you so. In this case, you should not update your device because it's going to be compatible with jailbreaks based on this exploit.
* If you get an error, it depends what error. The exploit can fail sometimes. Reboot and try again 2-3 more times. 
* If the app tells you it's not compatible at all, then you are out of luck. You can still try again, but won't likely get far. Still, do not update.
